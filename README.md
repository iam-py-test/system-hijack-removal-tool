# system-hijack-removal-tool
Remove unwanted system modifications from Windows systems (inc. broken exes) <br>
Note: Due to this tool being unsigned and containing the ability to modify critical parts of Windows, [some antivirus/antimalware scanners detect it as malware](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/0bf275d5aa9fa54400a7b337819bb8622eb6e1989ff95de9c437a9eee8de6114/detection). It is not malware, and I am working with the antivirus companies effected to resolve it. Feel free to read through the source code and compile it yourself.
